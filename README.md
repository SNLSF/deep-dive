# Deep Dive: Feminism 

A small project to showcase front end design using Ruby on Rails, Sass, and JavaScript. Still rocking an IE browser? Go ahead and take a look- it's lovely. On a mobile device? No prob. 

Future objectives:
* Find and replace symbols that will be better off with unicode
* Replace hipster ipsum with my actual thoughts on quotes that moved me
* Add a few more details to the influencer tiles to give user context
* Replace placeholder show pages for each book
* Add more influencers because the list is not complete without Niki Minaj. Yes I said it. 
* If a nav starts to make sense, I want to build a beautiful one
