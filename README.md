# Deep Dive: Feminism 

A small ongoing project to practice front end design using Ruby on Rails, Sass, and JavaScript.

Future objectives:
* Add transitions to carousel and rebuild JS.
* Build upon existing drawers. Add drawer speed transitions.
* Fix typos
* Find and replace symbols that will be better off with unicode.
* Replace hipster ipsum with my actual thoughts :)
* Add a few more details to the influencer tiles to give user context. Add transitions.
* Replace placeholder show pages for each book. 
* If a nav starts to make sense, build a beautiful one.
